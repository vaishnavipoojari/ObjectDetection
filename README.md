Intro

Object detection is a computer vision technique that enables a system to recognize objects from a set of pre-trained classes and boundaries in an image or video. This project presents an end-to-end solution tailored for autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and similar applications, focusing on the specific problem of forward-looking cameras.
Features

    Real-time object detection
    Detection and recognition of multiple objects simultaneously
    Adaptability to new datasets and labels
    Transfer learning for faster training and better accuracy

Technologies Used

    Python
    TensorFlow / PyTorch (based on implementation choice)
    OpenCV
    Pre-trained models (YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, etc.)
